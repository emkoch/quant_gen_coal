kill general in the title
A neutral coalescent model for quantitative trait distributions?

X fix schraiber and landis model figure

X use name other than stepping stone model

X use real values instead of integers

Frame as combining schraiber and Lohse papers

Describe why you can plug in mutational distribution

X show what a mutational distribution is X 

X introduce quantitative genetics generally.. how theres a distribution in the
population that depends on parameters of relatedness and trait architecture
and mutation

exmple to introduce biological and genealogical components even if mutational
distribution is normal, trait values can be non-normal, we know human populations no constant for instance

do case of bottleneck or growth rate

remove ET2 in denominator in kurtosis slide

introduce SL model and what they conclude from it
then talk about the mgf method that they used.
say we have a trove of mgf stuff from Lohse
I will give result that allows us to combine these

move kurtosis to the end

cite things not from me
kurtosis defin  ition is wrong

end with the kangaroo
