The Isserlis theorem states that the moments of a multivariate normal random
vector with mean zero is given by
\begin{equation}
  E[X_1X_2 \ldots X_n] = \sum \prod E[X_iX_j].
\end{equation}
The sum is over all possible ways of dividing the $n$ variables up into pairs,
and the product is over all pairwise expectations in that partition.
