\citet{Lohse2011} found general forms for the generating functions of genealogies.  In a coalescent model where events
$i$ occur at rate $ \lambda_i $, the moment generating function for the genealogy can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{T}\left[ \mathbf{T} \right] = \frac{
    \sum_i \lambda_i \varphi_i[\mathbf{s}]}{
    \sum_i \lambda_i + \sum_{|\omega|=1}s_{\omega}}.
\end{equation}
This is a convolution of the time to the first event with a mixture of times after the first event, where the mixture is
over all possible next events. We can apply this equation to a generalized structured population model where, $M$ is the
number of demes, $m_{i,j}$ is the migration rate from deme $i$ to deme $j$, $\eta_i$ is the coalescent rate within deme
$i$, and $\Omega = \{ \Omega_1, \Omega_2, \ldots , \Omega_M \}$ is the collection of lineages currently active in each
deme. In this model, events occur at rate
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^M \binom{|\Omega_i|}{2}\eta_i + \sum_{(i,j:i \neq j)} m_{i,j}|\Omega_i|,
\end{equation}
where the first term is due to coalescence events and the second term is due to migration events. We first define
operations on $\Omega$ due to these events. A event of lineage $\omega$ migrating from deme $i$ to deme $j$ would be
represented as $\Omega\left( i :-\omega, j: + \omega \right) := \{ \Omega\backslash \{\Omega_i, \Omega_j \} \} \cup
\{\Omega_j\backslash \omega, \Omega_i \cup \omega \}$. A coalescent event of lineages $x$ and $y$ in deme $i$ would be
written as $\Omega(i:x \cup y):=\{ \Omega \backslash \Omega)_i \}\cup\{ \{\Omega_i \cup xy \}\backslash \{ x,y \}\}$.
The overall generating function is then
\begin{align}
  \varphi_{\mathbf{T}}^{\Omega}(\mathbf{s}) &=
  \left( \sum_{i=1}^M \binom{|\Omega_i|}{2}\eta_i  + \sum_{(i,j:i \neq j)} m_{i,j}|\Omega_i| +
  \sum_{i=1}^M \sum_{\omega \in \omega_i : |\omega|=1}s_{\omega}\right)^{-1} \\
  &\times \left( \sum_{i=1}^M \eta_i \sum_{(x,y) \in \Omega_i:x \neq y}
  \varphi_{\mathbf{T}}^{\Omega(i:x \cup y)}(\mathbf{s}) + 
  \sum_{(i,j):i\neq j}m_{i,j}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega_i} \varphi_{\mathbf{T}}^{\Omega\left( i :-\omega, j: + \omega \right)}(\mathbf{s})\right).
\end{align}

If there are $N$ sample lineages, this gives a system of equations with $M^{\binom{N}{2}-1}$ which is a fuckton.
