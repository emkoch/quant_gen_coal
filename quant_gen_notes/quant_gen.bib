abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit
                  heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that
                  high levels of heritable variation may be maintained
                  by mutation in the face of stabilizing
                  selection. Several analyses have appeared of two
                  distinct models with n additive polygenic loci
                  subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each
                  is reviewed and a new analysis and model are
                  presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of
                  a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a
                  continuum of possible allelic effects at each
                  locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with
                  diallelic loci. The published analyses of these
                  models lead to qualitatively different predictions
                  concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic
                  variance on the underlying biological parameters. A
                  new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows
                  that the different predictions are not consequences
                  of the number of alleles assumed but rather are
                  attributable to assumptions concerning the relative
                  magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the
                  phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of
                  selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis
                  of a model with triallelic loci. None of the
                  approximate analyses presented are mathematically
                  rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the
                  domains of validity for alternative approximations,
                  numerically determined equilibria are presented. In
                  addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and
                  selection intensity are reviewed, revealing
                  weaknesses in both the data and its connection to
                  the models. Although the mathematical results and
                  underlying biological requirements of my analyses
                  are quite different from those of Lande , the
                  results do not refute his hypothesis that
                  considerable additive genetic variance may be
                  maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I
                  argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only
                  be determined with additional data and mathematics.},

@article{Lande2007,
abstract = {SUMMARYIt is assumed that a character under stabilizing
                  selection is determined genetically by n linked,
                  mutable loci with additive effects and a range of
                  many possible allelic effects at each locus. A
                  general qualitative feature of such systems is that
                  the genetic variance for the character is
                  independent of the linkage map of the loci, provided
                  linkage is not very tight. A particular detailed
                  model shows that certain aspects of the genetic
                  system are moulded by stabilizing selection while
                  others are selectively neutral. With reference to
                  experimental data on characters of Drosophila flies,
                  maize, and mice, it is concluded that large amounts
                  of genetic variation can be maintained by mutation
                  in polygenic characters even when there is strong
                  stabilizing selection. The properties of the model
                  are compared with those of heterotic models with
                  linked loci.},

@article{Schraiber2015,
abstract = {When models of quantitative genetic variation are built
                  from population genetic first principles, several
                  assumptions are often made. One of the most
                  important assumptions is that traits are controlled
                  by many genes of small effect. This leads to a
                  prediction of a Gaussian trait distribution in the
                  population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since
                  these biological assumptions are often unknown or
                  untrue, we characterized how finite numbers of loci
                  or large mutational effects can impact the sampling
                  distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we
                  developed a neutral coalescent-based framework,
                  allowing us to gain a detailed understanding of how
                  number of loci and the underlying mutational model
                  impacts the distribution of a quantitative
                  trait. Through both analytical theory and simulation
                  we found the normality assumption was highly
                  sensitive to the details of the mutational process,
                  with the greatest discrepancies arising when the
                  number of loci was small or the mutational kernel
                  was heavy-tailed. In particular, skewed mutational
                  effects will produce skewed trait distributions and
                  fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal
                  sampling distributions, even for traits controlled
                  by a large number of loci. Since selection models
                  and robust neutral models may produce qualitatively
                  similar sampling distributions, we advise extra
                  caution should be taken when interpreting
                  model-based results for poorly understood systems of
                  quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Analysis of genomic data requires an efficient way to
                  calculate likelihoods across very large numbers of
                  loci. We describe a general method for finding the
                  distribution of genealogies: we allow migration
                  between demes, splitting of demes [as in the
                  isolation-with-migration (IM) model], and
                  recombination between linked loci. These processes
                  are described by a set of linear recursions for the
                  generating function of branch lengths. Under the
                  infinite-sites model, the probability of any
                  configuration of mutations can be found by
                  differentiating this generating function. Such
                  calculations are feasible for small numbers of
                  sampled genomes: as an example, we show how the
                  generating function can be derived explicitly for
                  three genes under the two-deme IM model. This
                  derivation is done automatically, using
                  Mathematica. Given data from a large number of
                  unlinked and nonrecombining blocks of sequence,
                  these results can be used to find maximum-likelihood
                  estimates of model parameters by tabulating the
                  probabilities of all relevant mutational
                  configurations and then multiplying across loci. The
                  feasibility of the method is demonstrated by
                  applying it to simulated data and to a data set
                  previously analyzed by Wang and Hey (2010)
                  consisting of 26,141 loci sampled from Drosophila
                  simulans and D. melanogaster. Our results suggest
                  that such likelihood calculations are scalable to
                  genomic data as long as the numbers of sampled
                  individuals and mutations per sequence block are
                  small.},

abstract = {Selection on polygenic characters is generally analyzed by
                  statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal)
                  distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative
                  analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a
                  general representation of selection, recombination, and drift
                  to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic
                  effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are
                  absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of
                  breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our
                  analysis produces three results. First, our equations
                  reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive
                  variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal
                  how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter
                  these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak
                  selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable
                  to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive
                  effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of
                  breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating
                  multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means
                  can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard
                  selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be
                  negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including
                  mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values,
                  linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of
                  additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between
                  stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of these analytical
                  results is supported by numerical calculations.
