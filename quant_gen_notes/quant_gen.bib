abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit
                  heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that
                  high levels of heritable variation may be maintained
                  by mutation in the face of stabilizing
                  selection. Several analyses have appeared of two
                  distinct models with n additive polygenic loci
                  subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each
                  is reviewed and a new analysis and model are
                  presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of
                  a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a
                  continuum of possible allelic effects at each
                  locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with
                  diallelic loci. The published analyses of these
                  models lead to qualitatively different predictions
                  concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic
                  variance on the underlying biological parameters. A
                  new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows
                  that the different predictions are not consequences
                  of the number of alleles assumed but rather are
                  attributable to assumptions concerning the relative
                  magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the
                  phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of
                  selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis
                  of a model with triallelic loci. None of the
                  approximate analyses presented are mathematically
                  rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the
                  domains of validity for alternative approximations,
                  numerically determined equilibria are presented. In
                  addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and
                  selection intensity are reviewed, revealing
                  weaknesses in both the data and its connection to
                  the models. Although the mathematical results and
                  underlying biological requirements of my analyses
                  are quite different from those of Lande , the
                  results do not refute his hypothesis that
                  considerable additive genetic variance may be
                  maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I
                  argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only
                  be determined with additional data and mathematics.},

abstract = {SUMMARYIt is assumed that a character under stabilizing
                  selection is determined genetically by n linked,
                  mutable loci with additive effects and a range of
                  many possible allelic effects at each locus. A
                  general qualitative feature of such systems is that
                  the genetic variance for the character is
                  independent of the linkage map of the loci, provided
                  linkage is not very tight. A particular detailed
                  model shows that certain aspects of the genetic
                  system are moulded by stabilizing selection while
                  others are selectively neutral. With reference to
                  experimental data on characters of Drosophila flies,
                  maize, and mice, it is concluded that large amounts
                  of genetic variation can be maintained by mutation
                  in polygenic characters even when there is strong
                  stabilizing selection. The properties of the model
                  are compared with those of heterotic models with
                  linked loci.},

abstract = {When models of quantitative genetic variation are built
                  from population genetic first principles, several
                  assumptions are often made. One of the most
                  important assumptions is that traits are controlled
                  by many genes of small effect. This leads to a
                  prediction of a Gaussian trait distribution in the
                  population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since
                  these biological assumptions are often unknown or
                  untrue, we characterized how finite numbers of loci
                  or large mutational effects can impact the sampling
                  distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we
                  developed a neutral coalescent-based framework,
                  allowing us to gain a detailed understanding of how
                  number of loci and the underlying mutational model
                  impacts the distribution of a quantitative
                  trait. Through both analytical theory and simulation
                  we found the normality assumption was highly
                  sensitive to the details of the mutational process,
                  with the greatest discrepancies arising when the
                  number of loci was small or the mutational kernel
                  was heavy-tailed. In particular, skewed mutational
                  effects will produce skewed trait distributions and
                  fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal
                  sampling distributions, even for traits controlled
                  by a large number of loci. Since selection models
                  and robust neutral models may produce qualitatively
                  similar sampling distributions, we advise extra
                  caution should be taken when interpreting
                  model-based results for poorly understood systems of
                  quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Analysis of genomic data requires an efficient way to
                  calculate likelihoods across very large numbers of
                  loci. We describe a general method for finding the
                  distribution of genealogies: we allow migration
                  between demes, splitting of demes [as in the
                  isolation-with-migration (IM) model], and
                  recombination between linked loci. These processes
                  are described by a set of linear recursions for the
                  generating function of branch lengths. Under the
                  infinite-sites model, the probability of any
                  configuration of mutations can be found by
                  differentiating this generating function. Such
                  calculations are feasible for small numbers of
                  sampled genomes: as an example, we show how the
                  generating function can be derived explicitly for
                  three genes under the two-deme IM model. This
                  derivation is done automatically, using
                  Mathematica. Given data from a large number of
                  unlinked and nonrecombining blocks of sequence,
                  these results can be used to find maximum-likelihood
                  estimates of model parameters by tabulating the
                  probabilities of all relevant mutational
                  configurations and then multiplying across loci. The
                  feasibility of the method is demonstrated by
                  applying it to simulated data and to a data set
                  previously analyzed by Wang and Hey (2010)
                  consisting of 26,141 loci sampled from Drosophila
                  simulans and D. melanogaster. Our results suggest
                  that such likelihood calculations are scalable to
                  genomic data as long as the numbers of sampled
                  individuals and mutations per sequence block are
                  small.},

abstract = {Selection on polygenic characters is generally analyzed by
                  statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal)
                  distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative
                  analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a
                  general representation of selection, recombination, and drift
                  to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic
                  effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are
                  absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of
                  breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our
                  analysis produces three results. First, our equations
                  reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive
                  variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal
                  how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter
                  these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak
                  selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable
                  to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive
                  effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of
                  breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating
                  multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means
                  can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard
                  selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be
                  negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including
                  mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values,
                  linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of
                  additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between
                  stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of these analytical
                  results is supported by numerical calculations.

abstract = {Several attempts have already been made to interpret the well-established results of biometry in accordance with the Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations $\sigma$ 1 and $\sigma$ 2 , it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

Boag and Grant documented directional selection in a small population of Darwin's medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, on I. Daphne Major, Galapagos, in 1977. Large beak and body size were favoured at a time of diminishing food supply and high adult mortality. We show here that in two subsequent periods of moderate to high adult mortality (1980 and 1982), the population was subject to the same selection. We have used a recently developed technique to ascertain the targets of direct selection. Beak depth and body weight were commonly under direct selection to increase but, surprisingly, beak width was directly selected to decrease, over all three periods of mortality. The results have implications for our understanding of evolutionary change in morphological traits of Darwin's finches.},

Here we develop statistical approaches to the comparison of G with vectors of linear and nonlinear selection. We apply these approaches to a set of male sexually selected cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of Drosophila serrata. Even though male CHCs displayed substantial additive genetic variance, more than 99{\%} of the genetic variance was orientated 74.9 degrees away from the vector of linear sexual selection, suggesting that open-ended female preferences may greatly reduce genetic variation in male display traits. Although the orientation of G and the fitness surface were found to differ significantly, the similarity present in eigenstructure was a consequence of traits under weak linear selection and strong nonlinear (convex) selection. Associating the eigenstructure of G with vectors of linear and nonlinear selection may provide a way of determining what long-term changes in G may be generated by the processes of natural and sexual selection.},

abstract = {The G matrix measures the components of phenotypic variation that are genetically heritable. The structure of G, that is, its principal components and their associated variances, determines, in part, the direction and speed of multivariate trait evolution. In this article we present a framework and results that give the structure of G under the assumption of neutrality. We suggest that a neutral expectation of the structure of G is important because it gives a null expectation for the structure of G from which the unique consequences of selection can be determined. We demonstrate how the processes of mutation, recombination, and drift shape the structure of G. Furthermore, we demonstrate how shared common ancestry between segregating alleles shapes the structure of G. Our results show that shared common ancestry, which manifests itself in the form of a gene genealogy, causes the structure of G to be nonuniform in that the variances associated with the principal components of G decline at an approximately exponential rate. Furthermore we show that the extent of the nonuniformity in the structure of G is enhanced with declines in mutation rates, recombination rates, and numbers of loci and is dependent on the pattern and modality of mutation.},

abstract = {While it is now widely accepted that the rate of phenotypic evolution may not necessarily be constant across large phylogenies, the frequency and phylogenetic position of periods of rapid evolution remain unclear. In his highly influential view of evolution, G. G. Simpson supposed that such evolutionary jumps occur when organisms transition into so called new adaptive zones, for instance after dispersal into a new geographic area, after rapid climatic changes, or following the appearance of an evolutionary novelty. Only recently, large, accurate and well calibrated phylogenies have become available that allow testing this hypothesis directly, yet inferring evolutionary jumps remains computationally very challenging. Here, we develop a computationally highly efficient algorithm to accurately infer the rate and strength of evolutionary jumps as well as their phylogenetic location. Following previous work we model evolutionary jumps as a compound process, but introduce a novel approach to sample jump configurations that does not require matrix inversions and thus naturally scales to large trees. We then make use of this development to infer evolutionary jumps in Anolis lizards and Loriinii parrots where we find strong signal for such jumps at the basis of clades that transitioned into new adaptive zones, just as postulated by Simpson's hypothesis.},

@article{Freckleton2002,
abstract = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation, l, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations show l to be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, l is robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eightyeight percent of data sets contained at least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic dependence, and 60{\%} of characters overall (pooled across studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16{\%} of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the parameter l be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how this may be done.},

@article{Lynch1986,
abstract = {A general model is developed for predicting the genetic variance within populations and the rate of divergence of population mean phenotypes for quantitative traits under the joint operation of random sampling drift and mutation in the absence of selection. In addition to incorporating the dominance effects of mutant alleles, the model yields some insight into the effects of linkage and the mating system on the mutational production of quantitative-genetic variation. Despite these additional and potentially serious complications, it is found that, for small populations, the simple predictions obtained by previous investigators using additive-genetic models hold reasonably well. Even after accounting for dominance and linkage, the equilibrium level of genetic variance is unlikely to be much less than 2NVm or to be more than 4NVm, where N is the effective population size and Vm is the new variance from mutation appearing each generation. The rate of increase of the between-line variance per generation ultimately equals 2Vm regardless of population size, although the time to attain the asymptotic rate is proportional to N. Expressions are presented for the rate of approach to the equilibrium level of genetic variance and for the expected variance of the within-population and between-population genetic variances. The relevance of the derived model, which amounts to a generalization of the neutral theory to the phenotypic level, is discussed in the context of the detection of natural selection, the maintenance of pure lines for biomedical and agricultural purposes, the development of genetic conservation programs, and the design of indices of morphological distance between species.},
