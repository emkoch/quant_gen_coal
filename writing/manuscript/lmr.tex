A useful simplification of the model is to ignore the possibility of more than
one mutation per locus, thus breaking the infinite sites assumption within loci.
This approximation is reasonable as long as nucleotide positions affecting the
trait are loosely linked throughout the genome. The mgf of the trait
distribution is greatly simplified by grouping terms of order two and above in
equation
\eqref{eq:fullmgf}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lowmut}
\varphi_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{k}) \approx \left[ 1 + \T \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}
  \E[T_\omega] \left( \psi\left( \sum_{a \in \omega} k_a\right) -1 \right) +
  O\left( \theta^2 \right))\right]^L.
\end{equation}
Derivation details are given in Appendix \ref{lmr_der}. Ignoring the
$O\left( \theta^2 \right)$ terms corresponds to allowing at most one mutation
per locus. Conveniently, the mgf of the trait then depends only on the expected
branch lengths $\E[T_{\omega}]$, whereas equation \eqref{eq:fullmgf} requires
higher order moments of branch lengths (e.g. $\E[T_{\omega_1}T_{\omega_2}]$). It
is therefore no longer necessary to know the mgf of the genealogical
distribution, and we can express moments of the trait distribution using
expected branch lengths calculated from coalescent models.
