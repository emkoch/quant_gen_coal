Thus far, the model assumes that loci are unlinked and can experience an
infinite number of mutations. However, a useful simplification is that at most
one mutation per locus occurs. This approximation is reasonable as long as the
nucleotide positions affecting the trait are loosely linked throughout the
genome. The low-mutation-rate approximation greatly simplifies the mgf of the
trait distribution such that it is no longer necessary to know the full form of
the mgf of the genealogy:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lowmut}
\varphi_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{k}) \approx \left[ 1 + \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}
  \E[T_\omega] \T \left( \psi\left( \sum_{a \in \omega} k_a\right) -1 \right) +
  O\left( \theta^2 \right))\right]^L.
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:lowmut} ignores terms that are order two and above in the
mutation rate. Conveniently this equation depends only on the expected length of
each branch, whereas equation \eqref{eq:fullmgf} requires moments of branch
lengths order two and greater. We can use equation \eqref{eq:lowmut} to express
moments of the trait distribution in terms of expected branch lengths calculated
from coalescent models.
