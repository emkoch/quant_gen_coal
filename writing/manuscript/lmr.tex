A useful simplification of the model considered so far is to ignore the
possibility of more than one mutation per locus. This approximation is
reasonable as long as the nucleotide positions affecting the trait are loosely
linked throughout the genome. The low-mutation-rate approximation greatly
simplifies the mgf of the trait distribution such that it is no longer necessary
to know the full form of the mgf of the genealogy:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lowmut}
\varphi_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{k}) \approx \left[ 1 + \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}
  \E[T_\omega] \T \left( \psi\left( \sum_{a \in \omega} k_a\right) -1 \right) +
  O\left( \theta^2 \right))\right]^L.
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:lowmut} ignores terms that are order two and above in the
mutation rate. Conveniently, the mgf of the trait values depends only on the
expected length of each branch, whereas equation \eqref{eq:fullmgf} requires
second order and greater moments of branch lengths (e.g.
$\E[T_{\omega_1}T_{\omega_2}]$). We can use equation \eqref{eq:lowmut} to
express moments of the trait distribution in terms of expected branch lengths
calculated from coalescent models.
