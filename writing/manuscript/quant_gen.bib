abstract = {To test whether quantitative traits are under directional or
                  homogenizing selection, it is common practice to compare
                  population differentiation estimates at molecular markers
                  (F(ST)) and quantitative traits (Q(ST)). If the trait is
                  neutral and its determinism is additive, then theory predicts
                  that Q(ST) = F(ST), while Q(ST) {\textgreater} F(ST) is
                  predicted under directional selection for different local
                  optima, and Q(ST) {\textless} F(ST) is predicted under
                  homogenizing selection. However, nonadditive effects can alter
                  these predictions. Here, we investigate the influence of
                  dominance on the relation between Q(ST) and F(ST) for neutral
                  traits. Using analytical results and computer simulations, we
                  show that dominance generally deflates Q(ST) relative to
                  F(ST). Under inbreeding, the effect of dominance vanishes, and
                  we show that for selfing species, a better estimate of Q(ST)
                  is obtained from selfed families than from half-sib families.
                  We also compare several sampling designs and find that it is
                  always best to sample many populations ({\textgreater}20) with
                  few families (five) rather than few populations with many
                  families. Provided that estimates of Q(ST) are derived from
                  individuals originating from many populations, we conclude
                  that the pattern Q(ST) {\textgreater} F(ST), and hence the
                  inference of directional selection for different local optima,
                  is robust to the effect of nonadditive gene actions.},

                  alongside a genotype–phenotype map can provide insight about
                  phenotypic variation among groups. We generalize a simple
                  model of a completely heritable, additive, selectively neutral
                  quantitative trait to examine the relationship between
                  single-locus genetic differentiation and phenotypic
                  differentiation on quantitative traits. In agreement with
                  similar efforts using different models, we show that the
                  expected degree to which two groups differ on a neutral
                  quantitative trait is not strongly affected by the number of
                  genetic loci that influence the trait: neutral trait
                  differences are expected to have a magnitude comparable to the
                  genetic differences at a single neutral locus. We discuss this
                  result with respect to population differences in disease
                  phenotypes, arguing that although neutral genetic differences
                  between populations can contribute to specific differences
                  between populations in health outcomes, systematic patterns of
                  difference that run in the same direction for many genetically
                  independent health conditions are unlikely to be explained by

                  single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies in
                  populations with time-varying size. Our approach is based on
                  deriving analytical expressions for frequencies of SNPs.
                  Analytical expressions allow for computations that are faster
                  and more accurate than Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to
                  other articles showing analytical formulas for frequencies of
                  SNPs, we derive expressions that contain coefficients that do
                  not explode when the genealogy size increases. We also provide
                  analytical formulas to describe the way in which the
                  ascertainment procedure modifies SNP distributions. Using our
                  methods, we study the power to test the hypothesis of
                  exponential population expansion vs. the hypothesis of

                  demographic parameters estimation to those obtained in
                  previous studies in population genetics. The analyzed data
                  seem consistent with the hypothesis of past population growth
                  of modern humans. The analysis of the data also shows a very

                  that allows for evolutionary inferences at micro- and
                  macroevolutionary scales. A major advantage of this model is
                  its ability to incorporate genealogical discordance underlying
                  a quantitative trait. We show that discordance causes a
                  decrease in the expected trait covariance between more closely
                  related species relative to more distantly related species. If
                  unaccounted for, this outcome can lead to an overestimation of
                  a trait's evolutionary rate, to a decrease in its phylogenetic
                  signal, and to errors when examining shifts in mean trait
                  values. The number of loci controlling a quantitative trait
                  appears to be irrelevant to all trends reported, and
                  discordance also affected discrete, threshold traits. Our

                  long-range linkage properties. Analysing the results of

abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between probabilities of
                  identity by descent and the distribution of coalescence times.
                  By using the relationship between coalescence times and
                  identity probabilities, it is possible to extend existing
                  results for inbreeding coefficients in regular systems of
                  mating to find the distribution of coalescence times and the
                  mean coalescence times. It is also possible to express Sewall
                  Wright's FST as the ratio of average coalescence times of
                  different pairs of genes. That simplifies the analysis of
                  models of subdivided populations because the average
                  coalescence time can be found by computing separately the time
                  it takes for two genes to enter a single subpopulation and
                  time it takes for two genes in the same subpopulation to
                  coalesce. The first time depends only on the migration matrix
                  and the second time depends only on the total number of
                  individuals in the population. This approach is used to find
                  FST in the finite island model and in one- and two-dimensional
                  stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of
                  approach of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are
                  discussed in terms of different measures of genetic distance.
                  It is proposed that, for the purposes of describing the amount
                  of gene flow among local populations, the effective migration
                  rate between pairs of local populations, M, which is the
                  migration rate that would be estimated for those two
                  populations if they were actually in an island model, provides
                  a simple and useful measure of genetic similarity that can be
                  defined for either allozyme or DNA sequence data.},

abstract = {The worldwide pattern of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
                  variation is of great interest to human geneticists,
                  population geneticists, and evolutionists, but remains
                  incompletely understood. We studied the pattern in noncoding
                  regions, because they are less affected by natural selection
                  than are coding regions. Thus, it can reflect better the
                  history of human evolution and can serve as a baseline for
                  understanding the maintenance of SNPs in human populations. We
                  sequenced 50 noncoding DNA segments each approximately 500 bp
                  long in 10 Africans, 10 Europeans, and 10 Asians. An analysis
                  of the data suggests that the sampling scheme is adequate for
                  our purpose. The average nucleotide diversity (pi) for the 50
                  segments is only 0.061{\%} +/- 0.010{\%} among Asians and
                  0.064{\%} +/- 0.011{\%} among Europeans but almost twice as
                  high (0.115{\%} +/- 0.016{\%}) among Africans. The African
                  diversity estimate is even higher than that between Africans
                  and Eurasians (0.096{\%} +/- 0.012{\%}). From available data
                  for noncoding autosomal regions (total length = 47,038 bp) and
                  X-linked regions (47,421 bp), we estimated the pi-values for
                  autosomal regions to be 0.105, 0.070, 0.069, and 0.097{\%} for
                  Africans, Asians, Europeans, and between Africans and
                  Eurasians, and the corresponding values for X-linked regions
                  to be 0.088, 0.042, 0.053, and 0.082{\%}. Thus, Africans
                  differ from one another slightly more than from Eurasians, and
                  the genetic diversity in Eurasians is largely a subset of that
                  in Africans, supporting the out of Africa model of human
                  evolution. Clearly, one must specify the geographic origins of
                  the individuals sampled when studying pi or SNP density.},

                  level according to a given probability distribution. The model
                  produces simple estimators for model parameters and allows

                  of evolutionary branch lengths, which are used to quantify
                  deviation from clock-like behavior of gene expression

                  (1) The majority of gene expression changes are consistent

                  population-level processes and mutation; however, the relative
                  impact of "survival of the fittest" and "arrival of the
                  fittest" on phenotypic evolution remains unclear. Assessing
                  the influence of mutation on evolution requires understanding
                  the relative rates of different types of mutations and their
                  genetic properties, yet little is known about the functional
                  consequences of new mutations. Here, we examine the spectrum
                  of mutations affecting a focal gene in Saccharomyces
                  cerevisiae by characterizing 231 novel haploid genotypes with
                  altered activity of a fluorescent reporter gene. 7{\%} of
                  these genotypes had a nonsynonymous mutation in the coding
                  sequence for the fluorescent protein and were classified as
                  "coding" mutants; 2{\%} had a change in the S. cerevisiae TDH3
                  promoter sequence controlling expression of the fluorescent
                  protein and were classified as "cis-regulatory" mutants;
                  10{\%} contained two copies of the reporter gene and were
                  classified as "copy number" mutants; and the remaining 81{\%}
                  showed altered fluorescence without a change in the reporter
                  gene itself and were classified as "trans-acting" mutants. As
                  a group, coding mutants had the strongest effect on reporter
                  gene activity and always decreased it. By contrast,
                  50{\%}-95{\%} of the mutants in each of the other three
                  classes increased gene activity, with mutants affecting copy
                  number and cis-regulatory sequences having larger median
                  effects on gene activity than trans-acting mutants. When made
                  heterozygous in diploid cells, coding, cis-regulatory, and
                  copy number mutant genotypes all had significant effects on
                  gene activity, whereas 88{\%} of the trans-acting mutants
                  appeared to be recessive. These differences in the frequency,
                  effects, and dominance among functional classes of mutations
                  might help explain why some types of mutations are found to be

                  change differ in their relative contributions to expression
                  differences in natural populations because of the combined
                  effects of mutation and natural selection. Here, we
                  investigate how new mutations create the regulatory variation
                  upon which natural selection acts by quantifying the
                  frequencies and effects of hundreds of new cis- and
                  trans-acting mutations altering activity of the TDH3 promoter
                  in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of
                  natural selection. We find that cis-regulatory mutations have
                  larger effects on expression than trans-regulatory mutations
                  and that while trans-regulatory mutations are more common
                  overall, cis- and trans-regulatory changes in expression are
                  equally abundant when only the largest changes in expression
                  are considered. In addition, we find that cis-regulatory
                  mutations are skewed toward decreased expression while
                  trans-regulatory mutations are skewed toward increased
                  expression. We also measure the effects of cis- and
                  trans-regulatory mutations on the variability in gene
                  expression among genetically identical cells, a property of
                  gene expression known as expression noise, finding that
                  trans-regulatory mutations are much more likely to decrease
                  expression noise than cis-regulatory mutations. Because new
                  mutations are the raw material upon which natural selection
                  acts, these differences in the frequencies and effects of cis-
                  and trans-regulatory mutations should be considered in models

                  Despite their potential phenotypic importance, the selective
                  pressures acting on regulatory processes in general and gene
                  expression levels in particular are largely unknown. Studies
                  in model organisms suggest that the expression levels of most

                  the accumulation of random-neutral changes and evolution by
                  natural selection. The following evolutionary analysis has
                  general applicability to biological and medical science
                  because it accounts for genetic relatedness and identifies
                  patterns of expression variation that are affected by natural
                  selection. To identify genes evolving by natural selection, we
                  allocate the maximum among-population variation to genetic
                  distance and then examine the remaining variation relative to
                  a hypothesized important ecological parameter (temperature).
                  These analyses measure the expression of metabolic genes in
                  common-gardened populations of the fish Fundulus heteroclitus
                  whose habitat is distributed along a steep thermal gradient.
                  Although much of the variation in gene expression fits a null
                  model of neutral drift, the variation in expression for 22{\%}
                  of the genes that regress with habitat temperature was far
                  greater than could be accounted for by genetic distance alone.
                  The most parsimonious explanation for among-population
                  variation for these genes is evolution by natural selection.
                  In addition, many metabolic genes have patterns of variation
                  incongruent with neutral evolution: They have too much or too
                  little variation. These patterns of biological variation in

abstract = {A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between
                  genetic variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect
                  disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that
                  drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association
                  signals tend to be spread across most of the genome—including
                  near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We
                  propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently
                  interconnected such that all genes expressed in
                  disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of
                  core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be
                  explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer
                  to this hypothesis as an “omnigenic” model.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable
                  ''factors'' contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation
                  could result. Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between
                  Mendelian inheritance and continuous trait variation by
                  assuming many loci, each with small effect, and by informally
                  invoking the central limit theorem. Barton et al. (2018)
                  rigorously analyze the approach to a multivariate Gaussian
                  distribution of the genetic effects for descendants of parents
                  who may be related. This commentary distinguishes three nested
                  approximations, referred to as ''infinitesimal genetics,''
                  ''Gaussian descendants'' and ''Gaussian population,'' each
                  plausibly called ''the infinitesimal model.'' The first and
                  most basic is Fisher's ''infinites-imal'' approximation of the
                  underlying genetics –namely, many loci, each making a small
                  contribution to the total variance. As Barton et al. (2018)
                  show, in the limit as the number of loci increases (with
                  enough additivity), the distribution of genotypic values for
                  descendants approaches a multivariate Gaussian, whose
                  variance–covariance structure depends only on the relatedness,
                  not the phenotypes, of the parents (or whether their
                  population experiences selection or other processes such as
                  mutation and migration). Barton et al. (2018) call this
                  rigorously defensible ''Gaussian descendants'' approximation
                  ''the infinites-imal model.'' However, it is widely assumed
                  that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian
                  approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in
                  a population follows a Gaussian — even if the population is
                  subject to non-Gaussian selection. This third ''Gaussian
                  population'' approximation, is also described as the
                  ''infinitesimal model.'' Unlike the ''Gaussian descendants''
                  approximation, this third approximation cannot be rigorously
                  justified, except in a weak-selection limit, even for a purely
                  additive model. Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely
                  used descriptions of selection-induced changes in trait means
                  and genetic variances, the ''breeder's equation'' and the
                  ''Bulmer effect.'' Future generations may understand why the
                  ''infinitesimal model'' provides such useful approximations in
                  the face of epistasis, linkage, linkage disequilibrium and
                  strong selection.},

abstract = {Detecting genetic signatures of selection is of great interest for
                  many research issues. Common approaches to separate selective
                  from neutral processes focus on the variance of F(ST) across
                  loci, as does the original Lewontin and Krakauer (LK) test.
                  Modern developments aim to minimize the false positive rate
                  and to increase the power, by accounting for complex
                  demographic structures. Another stimulating goal is to develop
                  straightforward parametric and computationally tractable tests
                  to deal with massive SNP data sets. Here, we propose an
                  extension of the original LK statistic (T(LK)), named T(F-LK),
                  that uses a phylogenetic estimation of the population's
                  kinship (F) matrix, thus accounting for historical branching
                  and heterogeneity of genetic drift. Using forward simulations
                  of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data under
                  neutrality and selection, we confirm the relative robustness
                  of the LK statistic (T(LK)) to complex demographic history but
                  we show that T(F-LK) is more powerful in most cases. This new
                  statistic outperforms also a multinomial-Dirichlet-based model
                  [estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)], when
                  historical branching occurs. Overall, T(F-LK) detects
                  15-35{\%} more selected SNPs than T(LK) for low type I errors
                  (P {\textless} 0.001). Also, simulations show that T(LK) and
                  T(F-LK) follow a chi-square distribution provided the
                  ancestral allele frequencies are not too extreme, suggesting
                  the possible use of the chi-square distribution for evaluating
                  significance. The empirical distribution of T(F-LK) can be
                  derived using simulations conditioned on the estimated F
                  matrix. We apply this new test to pig breeds SNP data and
                  pinpoint outliers using T(F-LK), otherwise undetected using
                  the less powerful T(LK) statistic. This new test represents
                  one solution for compromise between advanced SNP genetic data

abstract = {QST is a commonly used metric of the degree of genetic
                  differentiation among populations displayed by quantitative
                  traits. Typically, QST is compared to FST measured on
                  putatively neutral loci; if QST = FST, this is taken as
                  evidence of spatially heterogeneous and diversifying
                  selection. This paper reviews the uses, assumptions and
                  statistics of QST and FST comparisons. Unfortunately, QST/FST
                  comparisons are statistically challenging. For a single trait,
                  QST must be compared not to the mean FST but to the
                  distribution of FST values. The sources of biases and sampling
                  error for QST are reviewed, and a new method for comparing QST
                  and FST is suggested. Simulation results suggest that the
                  distribution of neutral FST and QST values are little affected
                  by various deviations from the island model. Consequently, the
                  distributions of QST and FST are well approximated by the
                  Lewontin–Krakauer prediction, even with realistic deviations
                  from the island-model assumptions.},

                  levels for all traits measured. Simultaneous allozymic
                  analysis on the same population samples indicate a moderate
                  degree of differentiation: GST = 0.28. No associations between

                  as the null hypothesis that neutral phenotypic evolution

                  impeded diversification for relative fitness. Analyses of
                  population differentiation for clutch size, age at
                  reproduction, and growth rate indicate that neutral phenotypic

abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit
                  heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that
                  high levels of heritable variation may be maintained
                  by mutation in the face of stabilizing
                  selection. Several analyses have appeared of two
                  distinct models with n additive polygenic loci
                  subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each
                  is reviewed and a new analysis and model are
                  presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of
                  a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a
                  continuum of possible allelic effects at each
                  locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with
                  diallelic loci. The published analyses of these
                  models lead to qualitatively different predictions
                  concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic
                  variance on the underlying biological parameters. A
                  new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows
                  that the different predictions are not consequences
                  of the number of alleles assumed but rather are
                  attributable to assumptions concerning the relative
                  magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the
                  phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of
                  selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis
                  of a model with triallelic loci. None of the
                  approximate analyses presented are mathematically
                  rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the
                  domains of validity for alternative approximations,
                  numerically determined equilibria are presented. In
                  addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and
                  selection intensity are reviewed, revealing
                  weaknesses in both the data and its connection to
                  the models. Although the mathematical results and
                  underlying biological requirements of my analyses
                  are quite different from those of Lande , the
                  results do not refute his hypothesis that
                  considerable additive genetic variance may be
                  maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I
                  argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only
                  be determined with additional data and mathematics.},

abstract = {SUMMARYIt is assumed that a character under stabilizing
                  selection is determined genetically by n linked,
                  mutable loci with additive effects and a range of
                  many possible allelic effects at each locus. A
                  general qualitative feature of such systems is that
                  the genetic variance for the character is
                  independent of the linkage map of the loci, provided
                  linkage is not very tight. A particular detailed
                  model shows that certain aspects of the genetic
                  system are moulded by stabilizing selection while
                  others are selectively neutral. With reference to
                  experimental data on characters of Drosophila flies,
                  maize, and mice, it is concluded that large amounts
                  of genetic variation can be maintained by mutation
                  in polygenic characters even when there is strong
                  stabilizing selection. The properties of the model
                  are compared with those of heterotic models with
                  linked loci.},

abstract = {When models of quantitative genetic variation are built
                  from population genetic first principles, several
                  assumptions are often made. One of the most
                  important assumptions is that traits are controlled
                  by many genes of small effect. This leads to a
                  prediction of a Gaussian trait distribution in the
                  population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since
                  these biological assumptions are often unknown or
                  untrue, we characterized how finite numbers of loci
                  or large mutational effects can impact the sampling
                  distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we
                  developed a neutral coalescent-based framework,
                  allowing us to gain a detailed understanding of how
                  number of loci and the underlying mutational model
                  impacts the distribution of a quantitative
                  trait. Through both analytical theory and simulation
                  we found the normality assumption was highly
                  sensitive to the details of the mutational process,
                  with the greatest discrepancies arising when the
                  number of loci was small or the mutational kernel
                  was heavy-tailed. In particular, skewed mutational
                  effects will produce skewed trait distributions and
                  fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal
                  sampling distributions, even for traits controlled
                  by a large number of loci. Since selection models
                  and robust neutral models may produce qualitatively
                  similar sampling distributions, we advise extra
                  caution should be taken when interpreting
                  model-based results for poorly understood systems of
                  quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Analysis of genomic data requires an efficient way to
                  calculate likelihoods across very large numbers of
                  loci. We describe a general method for finding the
                  distribution of genealogies: we allow migration
                  between demes, splitting of demes [as in the
                  isolation-with-migration (IM) model], and
                  recombination between linked loci. These processes
                  are described by a set of linear recursions for the
                  generating function of branch lengths. Under the
                  infinite-sites model, the probability of any
                  configuration of mutations can be found by
                  differentiating this generating function. Such
                  calculations are feasible for small numbers of
                  sampled genomes: as an example, we show how the
                  generating function can be derived explicitly for
                  three genes under the two-deme IM model. This
                  derivation is done automatically, using
                  Mathematica. Given data from a large number of
                  unlinked and nonrecombining blocks of sequence,
                  these results can be used to find maximum-likelihood
                  estimates of model parameters by tabulating the
                  probabilities of all relevant mutational
                  configurations and then multiplying across loci. The
                  feasibility of the method is demonstrated by
                  applying it to simulated data and to a data set
                  previously analyzed by Wang and Hey (2010)
                  consisting of 26,141 loci sampled from Drosophila
                  simulans and D. melanogaster. Our results suggest
                  that such likelihood calculations are scalable to
                  genomic data as long as the numbers of sampled
                  individuals and mutations per sequence block are

abstract = {Selection on polygenic characters is generally analyzed by
                  statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal)
                  distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative
                  analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a
                  general representation of selection, recombination, and drift
                  to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic
                  effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are
                  absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of
                  breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our
                  analysis produces three results. First, our equations
                  reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive
                  variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal
                  how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter
                  these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak
                  selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable
                  to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive
                  effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of
                  breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating
                  multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means
                  can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard
                  selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be
                  negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including
                  mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values,
                  linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of
                  additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between
                  stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of these analytical
                  results is supported by numerical calculations.

abstract = {Several attempts have already been made to interpret the
                  well-established results of biometry in accordance with the
                  Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to
                  ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more
                  general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in
                  which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it
                  will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes
                  of human variability. The great body of available statistics
                  show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its
                  mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and,
                  therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by
                  the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the
                  mean square error. When there are two independent causes of
                  variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform
                  population distributions with standard deviations $\sigma$ 1
                  and $\sigma$ 2 , it is found that the distribution, when both
                  causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is
                  therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to
                  deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure
                  of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of
                  the normal population to which it refers, and we may now
                  ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of
                  the total variance which they together produce. It is
                  desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the
                  basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly
                  understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on
                  the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of
                  causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between
                  the individual and the population, should be carefully
                  avoided.},

abstract = {The adaptive significance of morphological traits can be assessed by measuring and identifying the forces of selection acting on them. Boag and Grant documented directional selection in a small population of Darwin's medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, on I. Daphne Major, Galapagos, in 1977. Large beak and body size were favoured at a time of diminishing food supply and high adult mortality. We show here that in two subsequent periods of moderate to high adult mortality (1980 and 1982), the population was subject to the same selection. We have used a recently developed technique to ascertain the targets of direct selection. Beak depth and body weight were commonly under direct selection to increase but, surprisingly, beak width was directly selected to decrease, over all three periods of mortality. The results have implications for our understanding of evolutionary change in morphological traits of Darwin's finches.},

abstract = {Stabilizing selection has been predicted to change genetic variances and covariances so that the orientation of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) becomes aligned with the orientation of the fitness surface, but it is less clear how directional selection may change G. Here we develop statistical approaches to the comparison of G with vectors of linear and nonlinear selection. We apply these approaches to a set of male sexually selected cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of Drosophila serrata. Even though male CHCs displayed substantial additive genetic variance, more than 99{\%} of the genetic variance was orientated 74.9 degrees away from the vector of linear sexual selection, suggesting that open-ended female preferences may greatly reduce genetic variation in male display traits. Although the orientation of G and the fitness surface were found to differ significantly, the similarity present in eigenstructure was a consequence of traits under weak linear selection and strong nonlinear (convex) selection. Associating the eigenstructure of G with vectors of linear and nonlinear selection may provide a way of determining what long-term changes in G may be generated by the processes of natural and sexual selection.},

abstract = {The G matrix measures the components of phenotypic variation that are genetically heritable. The structure of G, that is, its principal components and their associated variances, determines, in part, the direction and speed of multivariate trait evolution. In this article we present a framework and results that give the structure of G under the assumption of neutrality. We suggest that a neutral expectation of the structure of G is important because it gives a null expectation for the structure of G from which the unique consequences of selection can be determined. We demonstrate how the processes of mutation, recombination, and drift shape the structure of G. Furthermore, we demonstrate how shared common ancestry between segregating alleles shapes the structure of G. Our results show that shared common ancestry, which manifests itself in the form of a gene genealogy, causes the structure of G to be nonuniform in that the variances associated with the principal components of G decline at an approximately exponential rate. Furthermore we show that the extent of the nonuniformity in the structure of G is enhanced with declines in mutation rates, recombination rates, and numbers of loci and is dependent on the pattern and modality of mutation.},

@article{Duchen2017,
abstract = {While it is now widely accepted that the rate of phenotypic evolution may not necessarily be constant across large phylogenies, the frequency and phylogenetic position of periods of rapid evolution remain unclear. In his highly influential view of evolution, G. G. Simpson supposed that such evolutionary jumps occur when organisms transition into so called new adaptive zones, for instance after dispersal into a new geographic area, after rapid climatic changes, or following the appearance of an evolutionary novelty. Only recently, large, accurate and well calibrated phylogenies have become available that allow testing this hypothesis directly, yet inferring evolutionary jumps remains computationally very challenging. Here, we develop a computationally highly efficient algorithm to accurately infer the rate and strength of evolutionary jumps as well as their phylogenetic location. Following previous work we model evolutionary jumps as a compound process, but introduce a novel approach to sample jump configurations that does not require matrix inversions and thus naturally scales to large trees. We then make use of this development to infer evolutionary jumps in Anolis lizards and Loriinii parrots where we find strong signal for such jumps at the basis of clades that transitioned into new adaptive zones, just as postulated by Simpson's hypothesis.},

abstract = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary
                  to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative
                  studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of a
                  measure of phylogenetic correlation, l, introduced by Pagel
                  (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic
                  independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct
                  proportion to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations
                  show l to be a statistically powerful index for measuring
                  whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and
                  whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, l is
                  robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which
                  demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will
                  improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess
                  whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations, we
                  present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic
                  comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and
                  were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate
                  about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most
                  acute. Eightyeight percent of data sets contained at least one
                  character that displayed significant phylogenetic dependence,
                  and 60{\%} of characters overall (pooled across studies)
                  showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In
                  16{\%} of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither
                  supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal
                  results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a
                  lack of power. We suggest that the parameter l be routinely
                  estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also
                  be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction
                  in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present
                  an example of how this may be done.},

                  operation of random sampling drift and mutation in the absence
                  of selection. In addition to incorporating the dominance
                  effects of mutant alleles, the model yields some insight into
                  the effects of linkage and the mating system on the mutational
                  production of quantitative-genetic variation. Despite these
                  additional and potentially serious complications, it is found
                  that, for small populations, the simple predictions obtained
                  by previous investigators using additive-genetic models hold
                  reasonably well. Even after accounting for dominance and
                  linkage, the equilibrium level of genetic variance is unlikely
                  to be much less than 2NVm or to be more than 4NVm, where N is
                  the effective population size and Vm is the new variance from
                  mutation appearing each generation. The rate of increase of
                  the between-line variance per generation ultimately equals 2Vm
                  regardless of population size, although the time to attain the
                  asymptotic rate is proportional to N. Expressions are
                  presented for the rate of approach to the equilibrium level of
                  genetic variance and for the expected variance of the
                  within-population and between-population genetic variances.

                  predictable from Wright's FST, the effective population size
                  and the mutational variance. The structure of quantitative
                  genetic variance in a subdivided metapopulation can be
                  predicted from results from coalescent theory, thereby
                  allowing single-locus results to predict quantitative genetic
                  processes. The expected total amount of additive genetic
                  variance in a metapopulation of diploid individual is given by
                  2Ne sigma m2 (1 + FST), where FST is Wright's among-population
                  fixation index, Ne is the eigenvalue effective size of the
                  metapopulation, and sigma m2 is the mutational variance. The
                  expected additive genetic variance within populations is given

                  by 4FSTNe sigma m2. These results are general with respect to
                  the types of population structure involved. Furthermore, the
                  dimensionless measure of the quantitative genetic variance
                  among populations, QST, is shown to be generally equal to FST
                  for the neutral additive model. Thus, for all population

abstract = {Adaptation in response to selection on polygenic phenotypes may
                  occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci.
                  Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to
                  identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge
                  about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun
                  to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we
                  combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population
                  genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been
                  influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS
                  provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci
                  to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given
                  phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of
                  allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic
                  value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an
                  arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model, we
                  develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations
                  between genetic values and specific environmental variables,
                  as well as a generalization of [Q(ST)/F(ST)] comparisons to
                  test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations.
                  Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual
                  populations or groups of populations that contribute to the
                  signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably
                  greater power than their single locus equivalents due to the
                  fact that they look for positive covariance between like
                  effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that

                  common, but the reasons for these differences are unknown.
                  Here we find that many independent loci contribute to
                  population genetic differences in height and body mass index
                  (BMI) in 9,416 individuals across 14 European countries. Using
                  discovery data on over 250,000 individuals and unbiased effect
                  size estimates from 17,500 sibling pairs, we estimate that
                  24{\%} (95{\%} credible interval (CI) = 9{\%}, 41{\%}) and
                  8{\%} (95{\%} CI = 4{\%}, 16{\%}) of the captured additive
                  genetic variance for height and BMI, respectively, reflect
                  population genetic differences. Population genetic divergence
                  differed significantly from that in a null model (height, P
                  {\textless} 3.94 x 10(-8); BMI, P {\textless} 5.95 x 10(-4)),
                  and we find an among-population genetic correlation for tall
                  and slender individuals (r = -0.80, 95{\%} CI = -0.95, -0.60),
                  consistent with correlated selection for both phenotypes.
                  Observed differences in height among populations reflected the
                  predicted genetic means (r = 0.51; P {\textless} 0.001), but
                  environmental differences across Europe masked genetic

abstract = {While it is well understood that the pace of evolution depends on
                  the interplay between natural selection, random genetic drift,
                  mutation, and gene flow, it is not always easy to disentangle
                  the relative roles of these factors with data from natural
                  populations. One popular approach to infer whether the
                  observed degree of population differentiation has been
                  influenced by local adaptation is the comparison of neutral
                  marker gene differentiation (as reflected in FST) and
                  quantitative trait divergence (as reflected in QST). However,
                  this method may lead to compromised statistical power, because
                  FST and QST are summary statistics which neglect information
                  on specific pairs of populations, and because current
                  multivariate tests of neutrality involve an averaging
                  procedure over the traits. Further, most FST-QST comparisons
                  actually replace QST by its expectation over the evolutionary
                  process and are thus theoretically flawed. To overcome these
                  caveats, we derived the statistical distribution of population
                  means generated by random genetic drift and used the
                  probability density of this distribution to test whether the
                  observed pattern could be generated by drift alone. We show
                  that our method can differentiate between genetic drift and
                  selection as a cause of population differentiation even in
                  cases with FST=QST and demonstrate with simulated data that it
                  disentangles drift from selection more accurately than
                  conventional FST-QST tests especially when data sets are
                  small.},

                  several adaptive forms has received increased attention in
                  recent years, but the underlying mechanisms in this process
                  are still under debate. Postglacial fishes are excellent model
                  organisms for exploring this process, especially the initial
                  stages of ecological speciation, as postglacial lakes
                  represent replicated discrete environments with variation in
                  available niches. Here, we combine data of niche utilization,
                  trophic morphology, and 17 microsatellite loci to investigate
                  the diversification process of three sympatric European
                  whitefish morphs from three northern Fennoscandian lakes. The
                  morphological divergence in the gill raker number among the
                  whitefish morphs was related to the utilization of different
                  trophic niches and was associated with reproductive isolation
                  within and across lakes. The intralacustrine comparison of
                  whitefish morphs showed that these systems represent two
                  levels of adaptive divergence: (1) a consistent
                  littoral-pelagic resource axis; and (2) a more variable
                  littoral-profundal resource axis. The results also indicate
                  that the profundal whitefish morph has diverged repeatedly
                  from the ancestral littoral whitefish morph in sympatry in two
                  different watercourses. In contrast, all the analyses
                  performed revealed clustering of the pelagic whitefish morphs
                  across lakes suggesting parallel postglacial immigration with
                  the littoral whitefish morph into each lake. Finally, the
                  analyses strongly suggested that the trophic adaptive trait,
                  number of gill rakers, was under diversifying selection in the
                  different whitefish morphs. Together, the results support a
                  complex evolutionary scenario where ecological speciation
                  acts, but where both allopatric (colonization history) and
                  sympatric (within watercourse divergence) processes are
                  involved.},

                  (flatness, pointiness or modality) of a distribution is

                  set the record straight. This article puts the notion to rest

                  the shape of the peak - its only unambiguous interpretation is
                  in terms of tail extremity; i.e., either existing outliers
                  (for the sample kurtosis) or propensity to produce outliers
                  (for the kurtosis of a probability distribution). To clarify
                  this point, relevant literature is reviewed, counterexample
                  distributions are given, and it is shown that the proportion

                  key to elucidating the underlying mechanisms of complex
                  traits. Here, for the first time, we perform a systematic
                  survey of the heritability and the distribution of effect
                  sizes across all representative tissues in the human
                  body.Wefind that local h2 can be relatively well characterized
                  with 59{\%} of expressed genes showing significant h2 (FDR
                  {\textless} 0.1) in theDGN whole blood cohort. How- ever,
                  current sample sizes (n 922) do not allow us to compute distal
                  h2. Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) analysis
                  provides strong evidence that the genetic contribu- tion to
                  local expression traits is dominated by a handful of genetic
                  variants rather than by the collective contribution of a large
                  number of variants each of modest size. In other words, the
                  local architecture of gene expression traits is sparse rather
                  than polygenic across all 40 tissues (from DGN and GTEx)
                  examined. This result is confirmed by the spar- sity of
                  optimal performing gene expression predictors via elastic net
                  modeling. To further explore the tissue context specificity,
                  we decompose the expression traits into cross-tissue and
                  tissue-specific components using a novel Orthogonal Tissue
                  Decomposition (OTD) approach. Through a series of simulations
                  we show that the cross-tissue and tissue-spe- cific components
                  are identifiable via OTD. Heritability and sparsity estimates
                  of these derived expression phenotypes show similar
                  characteristics to the original traits. Consistent properties
                  relative to prior GTEx multi-tissue analysis results suggest
                  that these traits reflect the expected biology. Finally, we
                  apply this knowledge to develop prediction models of gene
                  expression traits for all tissues. The prediction models,
                  heritability, and prediction performance R2 for original and
