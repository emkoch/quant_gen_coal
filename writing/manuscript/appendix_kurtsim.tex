This appendix investigates how the kurtosis, rather than the expected fourth
moment of the within-population trait distribution responds to demography and
sparsity. Equations \eqref{eq:emoms}a-c and Figure \ref{fig:Qexp} only show the
response of the fourth moment. The kurtosis proves difficult to deal with
analytically. A first order approximation proves to be poor and simulations show
high variance of the within-population kurtosis.

    different levels of sparsity, mutational kernels, and demographies. The
    sparsity is varied by changing the expected number of pairwise differences
    at sites affecting the trait. Normal and Laplace distributions of mutational
    effects are compared. A constant size population is compared to an
    exponential growth scenario with growth rate equal to the reciprocal of the
    final effective population size. Green triangles denote the mean kurtosis.
    The dashed red lines give the first order approximation to the expected
    kurtosis given in equation \ref{eq:firstord}.}

Entire populations were simulated using \texttt{msprime} \citep{Kelleher2015}
and mutations were assigned effects from a standard normal or Laplace
distribution. The effective population size and mutation rate were kept constant
and the expected number of pairwise difference was increased by increasing the
number of loci affecting the trait.

A first order approximation to the kurtosis is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:firstord} 
\kappa_Y^{(1)} = 3 + \frac{m_4/m_2^2 \frac{\CCC}{\E[\mathbbm{T}_{2,2}]}} {L \T \E[\mathbbm{T}_{2,2}]
    + m_4/m_2^2 \frac{\BBB}{\E[\mathbbm{T}_{2,2}]}}.
\end{equation}
Although this expression suggests that the expected $\kappa_Y$ will be greater
than under normality when external branches are longer ($\E[\mathbbm{T}_{4,4}] >
\frac{1}{6}\E[\mathbbm{T}_{3,4}] + \frac{1}{9}\E[\mathbbm{T}_{2,4}]$) and less
than under normality when they are longer ($\E[\mathbbm{T}_{4,4}] <
\frac{1}{6}\E[\mathbbm{T}_{3,4}] + \frac{1}{9}\E[\mathbbm{T}_{2,4}]$),
simulations show that the approximation is actually quite poor (Figure
\ref{fig:kurtsim}).
