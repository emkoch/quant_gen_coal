Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to write down a simple solution to
\eqref{eq:deriv} that would provide and expression for an arbitrary moment of
the distribution of trait values. For an order $n$ term one would need to sum
over all orders of expected branch length terms that would appear in the
expansion of \eqref{eq:mgf_approx_sub}. For each order of branch lengths one
would need to sum over all possible sets of branch lengths and moments for those
branch lengths such that the desired product of dummy variables raised to the
correct powers could be produced. Furthermore, one would need to calculate the
coefficient for this product of dummy variables.

The one positive aspect about calculating general moments under the low mutation
rate approximation is that they only depend on the expected branch lengths.
