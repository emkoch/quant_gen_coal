In any sample, the absolute phenotypic values will not be meaningful. It is differences between individuals sampled from
various sub populations that are of interest to us. We are therefore interested in the joint distribution of $Y_i-Y-j$
for each pair of individuals in the sample. Using the infinitesimal model with a distribution of mutational effects
centered at zero the differences should have a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero. What matters is the
covariances of the differences.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cov}
  Cov[Y_1-Y_2,Y_3-Y_4]=Cov[Y_1,Y_3]+Cov[Y_2,Y_4]-Cov[Y_1,Y_4]-Cov[Y_2,Y_3]
\end{equation}
We know from previous results that $Cov[Y_1,Y_2]$ is proportional to the shared branch length of individuals $1$ and $2$
before the most recent common ancestor of the sample. We therefore have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:covprop}
  Cov[Y_1,Y_2] \propto E[T_{MRCA}]-E[\tau_{1,2}],
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:covcoal}
  Cov[Y_1-Y_2,Y_3-Y_4] \propto E[\tau_{1,4}] + E[\tau_{2,3}] - E[\tau_{1,3}] - E[\tau_{2,4}].
\end{equation}
Where $\tau_{1,2}$ is the expected coalescence time of individuals $1$ and $2$.
