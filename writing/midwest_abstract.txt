Neutral models for quantitative trait evolution have been useful for identifying
phenotypes under selection in natural populations. However, such models have
tended to start with a normal distribution of breeding values and assume a
particular form of population structure. I take a stab at developing and
analyzing a much more general model for the neutral distribution of a
quantitative trait. I start with the recent coalescent model developed by
Schraiber and Landis (2015) but show how this is a special case of a much more
general results that applies for arbitrary distributions of coalescent times.
The main mathematical result is to relate the moment generating function of the
genealogical distribution to that of the trait values. Limits are then taken to
show how this recovers the classic infinitesimal model, and it is shown how
arbitrary moments of the trait value distribution can be easily calculated under
a low mutation rate approximation. As an example deviations from normality are
investigated by calculating the expected kurtosis of a trait and showing how
this depends on both the mutational and genealogical distributions.
