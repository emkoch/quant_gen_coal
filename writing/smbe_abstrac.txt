The effects of demography and genetic architecture on the neutral distribution of quantitative traits

Neutral models for quantitative trait evolution have been useful for identifying phenotypes under selection in natural populations through goodness of fit tests. Such models nearly always start by assuming phenotypes are normally distributed, but traits such as gene expression levels are likely violate this assumption and have sparse genetic architectures. We develop and analyze a neutral model for quantitative traits that makes minimal assumptions about the genetic architecture or the distribution of coalescent times and hence the structure or demography of the population. This is done from a coalescent perspective by extending a model developed by Schraiber and Landis (2015) whose central result, the characteristic function for the distribution of trait values is shown to be a special case of ours. We analyze this model to show how a normal distribution is approached in an infinitesimal limit as the number of loci gets large as the effect size of mutations becomes small. We then demonstrate how deviations from the normal distribution depend on both demography and the genetic architecture. In particular, population growth exacerbates deviations while bottlenecks reduce them. Finally, we investigate the impact of sparse genetic architectures on testing for spatially varying selection and the possibility of inferring genetic architecture from trait values and genomic data.
